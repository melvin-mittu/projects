    <p style="margin-left: 2%;"><i>India, officially the Republic of India,is a country in South Asia. It is the
            seventh-largest country by area; the most populous country as of June 2023 and from the time of its
            independence in 1947, the world's most populous democracy.Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south,
            the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with
            Pakistan
            to the west China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian
            Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a
            maritime
            border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no
            later than 55,000 years ago.Their
            long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly
            diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the
            western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley
            Civilisation
            of the third millennium BCE.By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had
            diffused into India from the northwest.Its evidence today is found in the hymns of the Rigveda.
            Preserved by an oral tradition that was resolutely vigilant, the Rigveda records the dawning of Hinduism in
            India.The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.By 400 BCE,
            stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen,
            proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit
            Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging
            creativity,but also marked by the declining status of women,and the incorporation of untouchability
            into an organised system of belief.In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages
            scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.<br>In the early medieval era,
            Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on India's southern and western
            coasts.Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's northern plains,eventually
            founding the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval
            Islam.In the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in
            south India.In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion.The Mughal
            Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace,leaving a legacy of luminous
            architecture.Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company followed, turning India into
            a colonial economy, but also consolidating its sovereignty.British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights
            promised to Indians were granted slowly,but technological changes were introduced, and modern ideas
            of education and the public life took root.A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged,
            which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule.In
            1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions,a
            Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life
            and an unprecedented migration.
            India has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a democratic parliamentary system. It is a
            pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to
            almost 1.4 billion in 2022.During the same time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64
            annually to US$2,601, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a comparatively destitute country
            in 1951,India has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information technology services,
            with an expanding middle class.Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in
            global culture.India has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at the cost of increasing
            economic inequality.India is a nuclear-weapon state, which ranks high in military expenditure. It has
            disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.
            Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,and rising
            levels of air pollution.India's land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity hotspots.Its forest
            cover comprises 21.7% of its area.India's wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance
            in India's culture,is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in protected habitats.</i></p>
