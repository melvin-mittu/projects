    <p style="margin-left: 2%;"><i>Agra is a city on the banks of the Yamuna river
            in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, about 230 kilometres (140 mi) south-east of the national capital Delhi
            and 330 km west of the state capital Lucknow. With a population of roughly 1.6 million, Agra is the
            fourth-most populous city in Uttar Pradesh and twenty-third most populous city in India.
            Agra's notable historical period began during Sikandar Lodi's reign.Agra was the foremost city of the Indian
            subcontinent and the capital of the Mughal Empire under Mughal emperors Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir
            Aurangazeb and Shah Jahan. Under Mughal rule, Agra became a centre for learning, arts, commerce, and
            religion, and saw the construction of the Agra Fort, Sikandra and Agra's most prized monument, the Taj
            Mahal, built by Shah Jahan as a mausoleum for his favourite empress. With the decline of the Mughal empire
            in the late 18th century, the city fell successively first to Marathas and later to the East India Company.
            After Independence, Agra has developed into an industrial town, with a booming tourism industry, along with
            footwear, leather and other manufacturing. The Taj Mahal and the Agra Fort are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
            The city features mild winters, hot and dry summers and a monsoon season, and is famous for its Mughlai
            cuisine. Agra is included on the Golden Triangle tourist circuit, along with Delhi and Jaipur; and the Uttar
            Pradesh Heritage Arc, a tourist circuit of Uttar Pradesh, along with Lucknow and Varanasi.Agra has two
            histories: one of the ancient city on the east, or left, bank of the river Yamuna, going back so far as to
            be lost in the legends of Krishna and Mahabharata and reestablished by Sikandar Lodhi in 1504–1505; the
            other of the modern city, founded by Akbar in 1558, on the right bank of the river which is associated with
            the Mughals, and known throughout the world as the city of the Taj. Of ancient Agra little now remains
            except few traces of the foundations. It was a place of importance under various Hindu dynasties previous to
            the Muslim invasions of India, but its history is unclear, and possess little historical interest.The
            17th century chronicler named Abdhullah said it was a village before the reign of Sikandar Lodi. The king of
            Mathura had used the Agra fort as a jail. The degradation in the status of the site was a result of the
            destruction brought upon it by Mahmud of Ghazni.Masud Sa'd Salman claims to have been there when Mahmud
            assaulted Agra, claiming the Raja Japal surrendered after seeing a nightmare. Mahmud however proceeds to
            pillage the city.
            The Tomb of Mariam-uz-Zamani in Sikandra was originally built as a Baradari by Sultan Sikandar Lodi in 1495.
            Agra's period of historical importance began during Sikandar Lodi's reign. In 1504–1505, Sultan Sikandar
            Lodi , the Afghan ruler of the Delhi Sultanate, rebuilt Agra and made it the seat of
            government.Sikandar Lodhi appointed a commission which inspected and surveyed both sides of the
            Yamuna from Delhi to Etawah and finally chose a place on the left bank, or the east side of the Yamuna, as
            the site for the city. Agra on the left bank of the Yamuna grew into a large flourishing town with royal
            presence, officials, merchants, scholars, theologians and artists. The city became one of the most important
            centres of Islamic learning in India. The sultan founded the village of Sikandra in the northern suburbs of
            the city and built there a Baradari of red sandstone in 1495, which was converted into a tomb by Jahangir,
            and now stands as the Tomb of Mariam-uz-Zamani, Akbar's empress.
            After the Sultan's death in 1517, the city passed on to his son, Sultan Ibrahim Lodi .
            He ruled his sultanate from Agra until he was defeated and killed by Mughal Emperor Babur in the First
            battle of Panipat, fought in 1526.The golden age of the city began with the Mughals. Agra was the foremost
            city of the subcontinent and the capital of the Mughal Empire until 1658, when Aurangzeb shifted the entire
            court to Delhi.
            Babur the founder of the Mughal dynasty, acquired Agra after defeating the Lodhis and
            the Tomaras of Gwalior in the First Battle of Panipat in 1526.Babur's connection with Agra began
            immediately after the battle of Panipat. He sent forward his son Humayun, who occupied the town without
            opposition. The Raja of Gwalior, slain at Panipat, had left his family and the heads of his clan at Agra. In
            gratitude to Humayun, who treated them magnanimously, and protected them from plunder, they presented to him
            a quantity of jewels and precious stones as a token of homage. <br>Among these was the famous diamond
            Koh-i-nur.Babur went on to lay out the first formal Mughal garden in India, the Aram Bagh (or Garden of
            Relaxation) on the banks of the river Yamuna. Babur was determined to establish the seat of his government
            at Agra, but was almost dissuaded by the desolate appearance of the region, as clear from this quote from
            his memoir Baburnama.Very few vestiges remain of Babur's city, of his fruit and flower gardens, palaces,
            baths, tanks, wells and watercourses. The remnants of Babur's Charbagh can be seen today at Aram Bagh, on
            the east side of Yamuna.Babur was followed by his son Humayun ,
            but he was completely defeated at Kanauj in 1539, just nine years after his ascension, by Sher Shah Suri, an
            Afghan nobleman, who had submitted to Babur, but revolted against his son. In this brief interruption in
            Mughal rule between 1540 and 1556, Sher Shah Suri, established the short lived Sur Empire, and the region
            was eventually reconquered by Akbar in the Second Battle of Panipat in 1556.
            Under Akbar , and followed by his grandson Shahjahan, Agra was immortalised in the
            history of the world. Akbar built the modern city of Agra on the right bank of Yamuna, where the majority of
            its part still lies. He converted the city into a great centre of political, cultural and economic
            importance, connecting it with the various parts of his vast empire. Akbar raised the towering ramparts of
            the Agra Fort, besides making Agra a centre for learning, arts, commerce, and religion. Akbar also built a
            new capital city of Fatehpur Sikri, around 35 km from Agra. The new capital city was later
            abandoned.Before his death, Agra had become probably one of the biggest cities in the east, with
            huge amounts of trade and commerce happening through its bazaars.The English traveller Ralph Fitch who
            visited Agra in September 1585 in the life-time of Akbar, writes about the town.Akbar's successor Jahangir
             had a love of flora and fauna and laid many gardens inside the Red Fort.Akbar's
            mausoleum at Sikandra was completed during Jahangir's reign. The Jahangiri Mahal in Agra fort and the tomb
            of Itmad-ud-daulah were also constructed during the reign of Jahangir. Jahangir loved Lahore and Kashmir
            more than Agra, but the latter continued to be the first city of the realm.It was, however, Shah Jahan
             whose building activity raised Agra to the pinnacle of its glory. Shah Jahan, known
            for his keen interest in architecture, gave Agra its most prized monument, the Taj Mahal. Built in loving
            memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, the mausoleum was completed in 1653. The Jama Masjid and several other
            notable buildings like the Diwan-i-Am, the Diwan-i-Khas, the Moti Masjid, etc., inside the fort were planned
            and executed under his orders.
            Shah Jahan later shifted the capital to Shahjahanabad (now known as Delhi) in the year 1648,followed by
            his son Aurangzeb moving the entire court to Delhi in 1658. With this Agra began
            rapidly declining. Nevertheless, the cultural and strategic importance of Agra remained unaffected and in
            official correspondence it continued to be referred to as the second capital of the empire.The decline of
            the Mughal empire caused the emergence of several regional kingdoms, and in the late 18th century the
            control of the city fell successively to the Jats, the Marathas, the Mughals, the ruler of Gwalior, and
            finally the British East India Company.The Jats of Bharatpur, waged many wars against the Mughal Delhi
            and in the 17th and 18th century carried out numerous campaigns in Mughal territories including Agra.
            After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the city came under the influence of another post-Mughal Empire
            power, the Marathas, before falling into the hands of the British East India Company in 1803.In the
            years 1834–1836, Agra was the capital of the short-lived Presidency of Agra, administered by a Governor. It
            was then the capital of the North-Western Province from 1836 to 1858, governed by a
            Lieutenant-Governor.Agra was one of the centres of the Indian rebellion of 1857.</i></p></div>
