                    northern
                    India that has a central place in the traditions of pilgrimage, death, and mourning in the Hindu
                    world.The city has a syncretic tradition of Muslim artisanship that underpins its religious
                    tourism.Located in the middle-Ganges valley in the southeastern part of the state of Uttar Pradesh,
                    Varanasi lies on the left bank of the river. It is 692 kilometres (430 mi) to the southeast of
                    India's
                    capital New Delhi and 320 kilometres (200 mi) to the east of the state capital, Lucknow. It lies 121
                    kilometres (75 mi) downstream of Prayagraj, where the confluence with the Yamuna river is another
                    major
                    Hindu pilgrimage site.
                    Varanasi is one of the world's oldest continually inhabited cities.Kashi, its ancient name, was
                    associated with a kingdom of the same name of 2,500 years ago. The Lion capital of Ashoka at nearby
                    Sarnath
                    has been interpreted to be a commemoration of the Buddha's first sermon there in the fifth century
                    BCE.In the 8th century, Adi Shankara established the worship of Shiva as an official sect of
                    Varanasi. Tulsidas wrote his Awadhi language epic, the Ramcharitmanas, a Bhakti movement reworking
                    of
                    the
                    Sanskrit Ramayana, in Varanasi. Several other major figures of the Bhakti movement were born in
                    Varanasi,
                    including Kabir and Ravidas.In the 16th century, Rajput nobles in the service of the courts and
                    armies
                    of the Mughal emperor Akbar, sponsored the building or further enhancement of the major Shiva temple
                    in
                    the
                    city; they also built other temples, all displaying an empire-wide architectural style.Under the
                    Treaty of Faizabad, the East India Company acquired Benares in 1775,the city later successively
                    becoming a part of the Benares Division in the Ceded and Conquered Provinces, the North-Western
                    Provinces,
                    and the United Provinces, and after India's independence of Uttar Pradesh.
                    Silk weaving, carpets and crafts and tourism employ a significant number of the local population, as
                    do
                    the
                    Banaras Locomotive Works and Bharat Heavy Electricals. The city is known worldwide for its many
                    ghats,
                    steps
                    leading down the steep river bank to the water, where pilgrims perform rituals. Of particular note
                    are
                    the
                    Dashashwamedh Ghat, the Panchganga Ghat, the Manikarnika Ghat, and the Harishchandra Ghat, the last
                    two
                    being where Hindus cremate their dead. The Hindu genealogy registers at Varanasi are kept here.
                    Among
                    the
                    notable temples in Varanasi are Kashi Vishwanath Temple of Shiva, the Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple,
                    and
                    the
                    Durga Temple.
                    The city has long been an educational and musical centre: many prominent Indian philosophers, poets,
                    writers, and musicians live or have lived in the city, and it was the place where the Benares
                    gharana
                    form
                    of Hindustani classical music was developed. In the 20th-century the Hindi-Urdu writer Premchand and
                    the
                    shehnai player Bismillah Khan were associated with the city. India's oldest Sanskrit college, the
                    Benares
                    Sanskrit College, was founded during East India Company rule in 1791. Later education in Benares was
                    greatly
                    influenced by the rise of Indian nationalism in the late 19th-century. Annie Besant founded the
                    Central
                    Hindu College in 1898. In 1916, she and Madan Mohan Malviya founded the Banaras Hindu University,
                    India's
                    first modern residential university.<br> Kashi Vidyapith was established in 1921, a response to
                    Mahatma
                    Gandhi's
                    Non-cooperation movement.Traditional etymology links "Varanasi" to the names of two Ganges
                    tributaries
                    forming the city's borders: Varuna, still flowing in northern Varanasi, and Assi, today a small
                    stream
                    in
                    the southern part of the city, near Assi Ghat. The old city is located on the north shores of the
                    Ganges,
                    bounded by Varuna and Assi.
                    In the Mahabharata the city is referred to as Kāśī (काशी: Kashi) from the Sanskrit verbal root kaś-
                    "to
                    shine", making Varanasi known as "City of Light",the "luminous city as an eminent seat of
                    learning".The name was also used by pilgrims dating from Buddha's days.
                    Hindu religious texts use many epithets in Sanskrit to refer to Varanasi, such as Kāśikā
                    (transl. "the
                    shining one"), Avimukta (transl. "never forsaken by Shiva"), Ānandakānana (transl. "the forest of
                    bliss"),
                    Rudravāsa (transl. "the place where Rudra resides"), and Mahāshmashāna (transl. "the great cremation
                    ground").According to Hindu mythology, Varanasi was founded by Shiva,one of three principal deities
                    along with Brahma and Vishnu. During a conflict between Brahma and Shiva, one of Brahma's five heads
                    was
                    torn off by Shiva. As was the custom, the victor carried the slain adversary's head in his hand and
                    let
                    it
                    hang down from his hand as an act of ignominy, and a sign of his own bravery. A bridle was also put
                    into
                    the
                    mouth. Shiva thus dishonoured Brahma's head, and kept it with him at all times. When he came to the
                    city
                    of
                    Varanasi in this state, the hanging head of Brahma dropped from Shiva's hand and disappeared in the
                    ground.
                    Varanasi is therefore considered an extremely holy site.
                    The Pandavas, the protagonists of the Hindu epic Mahabharata, are said to have visited the city in
                    search of
                    Shiva to atone for their sins of fratricide and brahmahatya that they had committed during the
                    Kurukshetra
                    War.It is regarded as one of seven holy cities (Sapta Puri) which can provide Moksha; Ayodhya,
                    Mathura,
                    Haridwar, Kashi, Kanchi, Avanti, and Dvārakā are the seven cities known as the givers of
                    liberation.The
                    princesses Ambika and Ambalika of Kashi were wed to the Hastinapura ruler Vichitravirya, and they
                    later
                    gave
                    birth to Pandu and Dhritarashtra. Bhima, a son of Pandu, married a Kashi princess Valandhara and
                    their
                    union
                    resulted in the birth of Sarvaga, who later ruled Kashi. Dhritarasthra's eldest son Duryodhana also
                    married
                    a Kashi princess Bhanumati, who later bore him a son Lakshmana Kumara and a daughter Lakshmanā.
                    The Cakkavatti Sīhanāda Sutta text of Buddhism puts forth an idea stating that Varanasi will one day
                    become
                    the fabled kingdom of Ketumati in the time of Maitreya.Excavations in 2014 led to the discovery of
                    artefacts
                    dating back to 800 BCE. Further excavations at Aktha and Ramnagar, two sites in the vicinity of the
                    city,
                    unearthed artefacts dating back to 1800 BCE, supporting the view that the area was inhabited by this
                    time.
                    During the time of Gautama Buddha, Varanasi was part of the Kingdom of Kashi.The celebrated Chinese
                    traveller Xuanzang, also known as Hiuen Tsiang, who visited the city around 635 CE, attested that
                    the
                    city
                    was a centre of religious and artistic activities, and that it extended for about 5 kilometres (3.1
                    mi)
                    along the western bank of the Ganges.When Xuanzang, visited Varanasi in the 7th century, he named
                    it "Polonise"and wrote that the city had some 30 temples with about 30 monks.The city's
                    religious importance continued to grow in the 8th century, when Adi Shankara established the worship
                    of
                    Shiva as an official sect of Varanasi.</i></p>
