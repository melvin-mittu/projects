    <p style="margin-left: 2%;"><i>Lakshadweep (Malayalam: [lɐkʂɐd̪βʷiːbɨ̆]) is a union territory of India. It is an
            archipelago of 36 islands in the Arabian sea, located 200 to 440 km (120 to 270 mi) off the Malabar Coast.
            The name Lakshadweep means "one lakh islands" (one hundred thousand islands) in Tamil and Sanskrit, though
            the Laccadive Islands are just one part of the archipelago of no more than a hundred islands. Jeseri is the
            primary as well as the widely spoken native language in the territory.The islands form the smallest
            union territory of India and their total surface area is approximately 32 km2 (12 sq mi). The lagoon area
            covers about 4,200 km2 (1,600 sq mi), the territorial waters area 20,000 km2 (7,700 sq mi) and the exclusive
            economic zone area 400,000 km2 (150,000 sq mi). The region forms a single Indian district with 10
            subdivisions. Kavaratti serves as the capital of the Union Territory and the region comes under the
            jurisdiction of Kerala High Court. The islands are the northernmost of the Lakshadweep–Maldives–Chagos group
            of islands, which are the tops of a vast undersea mountain range, the Chagos-Lakshadweep Ridge.The
            Lakshadweep originally consisted of 36 islands; however, due to the Parali 1 island being submerged in water
            due to sea erosion, 35 islands remain.
            The islands were also mentioned in the Buddhist Jataka stories of the sixth century BCE. Islam was
            established in the region when Muslims arrived around the seventh century. During the medieval period, the
            region was ruled by the Chera dynasty, the Chola dynasty, and finally the Kingdom of Kannur. The Catholic
            Portuguese arrived around 1498 but were expelled by 1545. The region was then ruled by the Muslim house of
            Arakkal, who were vassals to the Kolathiri Rajas of Kannur, followed by Tipu Sultan. On his death in 1799,
            most of the region passed on to the British and with their departure, the Union Territory was formed in
            1956.
            Of the total 36 islands, 10 are inhabited. At the 2011 Indian census, the population of the Union Territory
            was 64,473. The majority of the indigenous population is Muslim and most of them belong to the Shafi school
            of the Sunni sect. The islanders are ethnically similar to the Malayali people of the nearest Indian state
            of Kerala. Most of the population speaks Jeseri with Dhivehi being the most spoken language in Minicoy
            island. Jeseri dialect is spoken in the inhabited islands of archipelago, namely Amindivi and Laccadive
            Islands, with an exception of the southernmost island of Minicoy,where the Mahl dialect is used.<br>The
            Ponnani script of Malayalam was used to write Jeseri until the British Raj.The culture is almost similar
            to that of Mappilas in the nearest mainland state of Kerala.The islands are served by an airport on
            Agatti Island. The main occupation of the people is fishing and coconut cultivation, with tuna being the
            main item of export.As the islands have no aboriginal inhabitants, scholars have suggested different
            histories for the settlement of these islands. Archaeological evidence supports the existence of human
            settlement in the region around 1500 BCE, Jataka stories of Buddhism has mentioned these islands, which
            documented the spread of Buddhism to the islands during 6th century BC.Buddhist era archaeological
            finds are also notable, during Buddhist era monk Sanghmitra is believed to have visited the island.The
            islands have long been known to sailors, as indicated by an anonymous reference from the first century CE to
            the region in Periplus of the Erythraean Sea.There are references to the control of the islands by the
            Cheras in the Sangam Patiṟṟuppattu. Local traditions and legends attribute the first settlement on these
            islands to the period of Cheraman Perumal, the last Chera king of Kerala.The oldest inhabited islands
            in the group are Amini, Kalpeni Andrott, Kavaratti, and Agatti.According to popular tradition, Islam was
            brought to Lakshadweep by Ubaidullah in 661 CE. His grave is located on the island of Andrott.
            The History of Islam in lakshadweep very clearly recorded in a book known as 'Futhuhathul Jaza'ir', this
            book in Arabic language was written by 'Abubakar ibn Ubaidulla, and the author was the son of Ubaidullah who
            invented Islam in lakshadweep.A manuscript copy of this book is still available, which was passed down from
            generation to generation.In the 16th century, the Portuguese ruled the seas between Ormus and the Malabar
            Coast and south to Ceylon. As early as 1498 when the Vasco da Gama arrived at Kozhikode during the Age of
            Discovery, they took control of the archipelago (called Laquedivas by them), later on to exploit coir
            production, until the islanders expelled them in 1545. In the mid 16th century all the inhabited islands of
            the Lakshadweep were conferred as jagir on the ruling family of the Cannanore Kingdom (Arakkal Kingdom) by
            the Chirakkal or Kolattiri Raja in order to grant protection from the Portuguese.The Arakkal kingdom
            had jurisdiction over Laccadive and Amindivi groups of islands, in addition to the city of Kannur. The
            islands are also mentioned in great detail in the stories of the Arab traveller Ibn Batuta.
            The Aminidivi group of islands (Amini, Kadmat, Kiltan, Chetlath, and Bitra) came under the rule of Tipu
            Sultan in 1787. They were passed to British control after the Third Anglo-Mysore War and were attached
            to Kasaragod Taluk of South Canara. The rest of the islands (Agatti, Andrott, Minicoy, Kavaratti,
            Kalpeni, and Bangaram) remained under the suzerainty of the Arakkal family of Kannur in return for a payment
            of annual tribute.The British took over the administration of those islands for nonpayment of arrears.
            These islands were attached to the Malabar district of the Madras Presidency during the British Raj.
            Later it was placed under Kozhikode Taluk.</i></p></div>
