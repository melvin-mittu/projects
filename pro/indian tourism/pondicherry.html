    <p style="margin-left: 2%;"><i>Puducherry, formerly known as Pondicherry, gained its significance as "The French
            Riviera of the East" after the advent of French colonialisation in India. Puducherry is the Tamil
            interpretation of "new town" and mainly derives from "Poduke", the name of the marketplace or "port town"
            for Roman trade in the 1st century, as mentioned in The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. The settlement was
            once an abode of learned scholars versed in the Vedas, hence it was also known as Vedapuri.
            The history of Puducherry can broadly be classified into two periods: pre-colonial and colonial. The
            pre-colonial period started with the reign of the Pallavas, who ruled the empire from 325 to 900, after
            which came the Chola dynasty, from 900 to 1279, and the Pandya dynasty, from 1279 to 1370. During the 14th
            century, the city was under the rule of Naikship of Gingee of the Vijayanagara Empire, from 1370 to 1614,
            when it was conquered by the Sultan of Bijapur, who ruled it from 1614 to 1638. It was during this period
            that Portuguese and Danish merchants used it as a trading center.
            The colonial period began with the Portuguese, the first Europeans to conduct trade in textiles, in 1521,
            and subsequently, the Dutch and the Danes in the 17th century.
            The prospering trade of Puducherry attracted the French, and the predominant feature of the town was laid by
            the French pioneer Francois Martin in the form of a French settlement, in 1674. In 1693, Puducherry was
            captured by the Dutch and subsequently restored in 1699, with the Treaty of Ryswick.
            The French acquired Mahé in 1720, Yanam in 1731, and Karaikal in 1738. The British captured the city from
            the French but returned it following the Treaty of Paris, in 1763. This Anglo-French war continued until
            1814, where France found itself in control of the settlements of Puducherry, Mahé, Yanam, Karaikal, and
            Chandernagor, even during the British period, until 1954. It was a reign of 138 years under the French, who
            on 31 October 1954 left Indian shores following a de facto transfer of power.
            Nearby places such as Arikamedu, Ariyankuppam, Kakayanthoppe, Villianur, and Bahour, which were colonised by
            the French East India Company over a period of time and later became the union territory of Pondicherry,
            have recorded histories that predate the colonial period.
            Poduke or Poduca (marketplace) was a Roman trading destination from the third century BCE.Poduca has
            been identified as possibly being Arikamedu (now part of Ariyankuppam), located about 2 miles (3.2 km) from
            the modern city of Pondicherry. The area was part of the Pallava Kingdom of Kanchipuram in the 4th century.
            The Cholas of Thanjavur held it from the 10th to the 13th centuries, until it was replaced by the Pandya
            Kingdom, in the 13th century. The Vijayanagar Empire took control of almost all of southern India in the
            14th century and maintained control until 1638, when they were supplanted by the Sultan of Bijapur.
            In 1674, the French East India Company set up a trading centre at Pondicherry, and this outpost eventually
            became the chief French settlement in India. <br>The French governor François Martin made remarkable
            improvements to the city and its commercial ties, facing at the same time strong opposition from the Dutch
            and the English. He entered into extended negotiations with the sultans of Golconda through the intercession
            of several roving French merchants and doctors who were in favour with the sultan. Trading in jewellery and
            precious stones, which had become highly fashionable in European courts, was one among many activities. Five
            trading posts were established along the south Indian coast between 1668 and 1674. The city was separated by
            a canal into the French Quarter and the Indian Quarter.
            On 21 August 1693, during the Nine Years' War, Pondicherry was captured by the Dutch. The governor of Dutch
            Coromandel, Laurens Pit the Younger, sailed with a fleet of seventeen ships and 1,600 men from Nagapattinam
            and bombarded Pondicherry for two weeks, after which Francois Martin surrendered it. At the Peace of
            Ryswick, it was agreed by all parties to return conquered territories, and in 1699, Pondicherry was handed
            back to the French.
            On 16 January 1761, the British captured Pondicherry from the French, but it was returned under the Treaty
            of Paris (1763), at the conclusion of the Seven Years' War. The British took control of the area again in
            1793, at the Siege of Pondicherry, amid the Wars of the French Revolution, and returned it to France in
            1814.
            Prime Minister Nehru visiting Pondicherry a few months after the de facto transfer
            On 18 March 1954, a number of resolutions were passed by the municipalities in Pondicherry, demanding an
            immediate merger with India. Some days later, similar resolutions were passed by the municipalities in
            Karaikal. The resolutions had the full support of the French Indian Councillors, popularly known as
            ministers, and the president of the representative assembly. These municipalities represented roughly 90% of
            the population of the French possessions, and they called upon the government of France to take urgent and
            necessary measures to give effect to the wishes of the people.[8] The government of India had made it clear
            that the cultural and other rights of the people would be fully respected. They were not asking for the
            immediate transfer of de jure sovereignty of France. Their suggestion was that a de facto transfer of the
            administration should take place immediately, while French sovereignty should continue until the
            constitutional issue had been settled. Both India and France would have to make necessary changes in their
            respective constitutions. All this would take time, while the demand of the people was for an immediate
            merger without a referendum. The government of India was convinced that the suggestion which they made would
            help to promote a settlement, which they greatly desired.
            On 18 October 1954, in a general election involving 178 people in municipal Pondicherry and the Commune of
            Panchayat, 170 people were in favour of the merger, and eight people voted against. The de facto transfer of
            the French Indian territories from French governance to the Indian union took place on 1 November 1954 and
            was established as the union territory of Pondicherry. The treaty effecting the de jure transfer was signed
            in 1956. However, due to opposition in France, the ratification of this treaty by the French National
            Assembly only took place on 16 August 1962.</i></p></div>
