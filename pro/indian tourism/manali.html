            deluged the world. The Kullu Valley in which Manali is situated is often referred to as the "Valley of the
            Gods". An old village in the town has an ancient temple dedicated to the sage Manu.Manali has grown from
            a trading village to a small town. As of the 2011 census of India, its population was 8,096. In 2001, Manali
            had an official population of 6,265. Males constituted 64% of the population and females 36%. Manali had an
            average literacy rate of 74%, male literacy was 80%, and female literacy was 63.9%. 9.5% of the population
            was under six years of age.Manali features a subtropical highland climate (Cfb) with warm summers,
            relatively cold winters, and a high diurnal temperature variation. The temperatures range from −7 °C (19 °F)
            to 30 °C (86 °F) over the year with the hottest day crossing 30 °C (86 °F) and the coldest day going below
            −7 °C (19 °F). The average temperature during summer is between 10 °C (50 °F) to 30 °C (86 °F), and between
