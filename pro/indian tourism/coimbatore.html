            the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is located on the banks of the Noyyal River and surrounded by the Western
            Ghats. Coimbatore is the second largest city in Tamil Nadu after Chennai in terms of population and the 16th
            largest urban agglomeration in India as per the census 2011. It is administered by the Coimbatore Municipal
            Corporation and is the administrative capital of Coimbatore District. In 1981, Coimbatore formed as the
            third municipal corporation in Tamil Nadu after Chennai and Madurai. Podanur Junction is the oldest railway
            station in Coimbatore City. The city is one of the largest exporters of jewellery, wet grinders, poultry and
            auto components; the "Coimbatore Wet Grinder" and the "Kovai Cora Cotton" are recognised as Geographical
            Indications by the Government of India. Being a hub of textile industry in South India, the city is
            sometimes referred to as the "Manchester of South India".It was ranked the 7th best city in India in
            the Ease of Living index 2020.
            The region around Coimbatore was ruled by the Cheras during the Sangam period between the 1st and the 4th
            centuries CE and it served as the eastern entrance to the Palakkad Gap, the principal trade route between
            the west coast and Tamil Nadu. Coimbatore was located along the ancient trade route Rajakesari Peruvazhi
            that extended from Muziris to Arikamedu in South India. The medieval Cholas conquered the Kongu Nadu in the
            10th century CE. The region was ruled by Vijayanagara Empire in the 15th century followed by the Nayaks who
            introduced the Palayakkarar system under which Kongu Nadu region was divided into 24 Palayams. In the later
            part of the 18th century, the Coimbatore region came under the Kingdom of Mysore and following the defeat of
            Tipu Sultan in the Anglo-Mysore Wars, the British East India Company annexed Coimbatore to the Madras
            Presidency in 1799. The Coimbatore region played a prominent role in the Second Poligar War (1801) when it
            was the area of operations of Dheeran Chinnamalai.
            In 1804, Coimbatore was established as the capital of the newly formed Coimbatore district and in 1866, it
            was accorded municipality status with Robert Stanes as its chairman. 24 November used to be Coimbatore Day,
            say those familiar with the history of Coimbatore.The city experienced a textile boom in the early 19th
            century due to the decline of the cotton industry in Mumbai. Post – Independence, Coimbatore has seen rapid
            growth due to industrialisation including the introduction of 3 malls in major locations. Coimbatore was
            ranked the best emerging city in India by India Today in the 2014 annual Indian city survey. The city was
            ranked fourth among Indian cities in investment climate by Confederation of Indian Industry and 17th among
            the top global outsourcing cities by Tholons. Coimbatore has been selected as one of the hundred Indian
            cities to be developed as a smart city under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's flagship Smart Cities Mission.
            Coimbatore regularly features among the top 10 best cities to live in India.<br> Coimbatore was rated as one of
            the safest cities in India for women according to National Crime Records Bureau report in 2015.The region
            around Coimbatore was ruled by the Cheras during Sangam period between c. 1st and the 4th centuries CE and
            it served as the eastern entrance to the Palakkad Gap, the principal trade route between the west coast and
            Tamil Nadu.The Kosar tribe mentioned in the 2nd century CE Tamil epic Silappathikaram and other poems
            in Sangam literature is associated with the Coimbatore region.The region was located along an ancient
            Roman trade route that extended from Muziris to Arikamedu.The medieval Cholas conquered the Kongu
            Nadu in the 10th century. A Chola highway called Rajakesari Peruvazhi ran through the region.Much
            of Tamil Nadu came under the rule of the Vijayanagara Empire by the 15th century. In the 1550s, Madurai
            Nayaks, who were the military governors of the Vijaynagara Empire, took control of the region. After the
            Vijayanagara Empire fell in the 17th century, the Madurai Nayaks established their state as an independent
            kingdom. They introduced the Palayakkarar system under which Kongu Nadu region was divided into 24
            Palayams.In the latter part of the 18th century, the region came under the Kingdom of Mysore,
            following a series of wars with the Madurai Nayak dynasty. After the defeat of Tipu Sultan in the
            Anglo-Mysore Wars, the British East India Company annexed Coimbatore to the Madras Presidency in 1799. The
            Coimbatore region played a prominent role in the Second Poligar War (1801), when it was the area of
            operations of Dheeran Chinnamalai.In 1804, Coimbatore was established as the capital of the newly
            formed Coimbatore district and in 1866 it was accorded municipality status.Sir Robert
            Stanes became the first chairman of the Coimbatore City Council.The region was hard hit during the
            Great Famine of 1876–78 resulting in nearly 200,000 famine related fatalities. The first three decades of
            the 20th century saw nearly 20,000 plague-related deaths and acute water shortage.
            The decline of the cotton industry in Mumbai fuelled an economic boom in Coimbatore in the 1920s and
            1930s.The region played a significant role in the Indian independence movement with Mahatma Gandhi
            visiting the city three times.Coimbatore was the base of operations for such political figures as S. P.
            Narasimhalu Naidu, R. K. Shanmukham Chetty, C.S. Rathinasabapathy and C. Subramaniam during the independence
            movement.Post independence, Coimbatore has seen rapid growth due to industrialisation and in 1981 it
            was constituted as a municipal corporation.On 14 February 1998, the radical Islamist group Al Ummah
            bombed 11 places across the city killing 58 people and injuring more than 200.</i></p></div>
