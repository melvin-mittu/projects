    <p style="margin-left: 2%;"><i>The Andaman and Nicobar Islands is a union territory of India consisting of 571
            islands, of which 37 are inhabited, at the junction of the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea. The
            territory is about 150 km (93 mi) north of Aceh in Indonesia and separated from Thailand and Myanmar by the
            Andaman Sea. It comprises two island groups, the Andaman Islands (partly) and the Nicobar Islands, separated
            by the 150 km (100 mile) wide Ten Degree Channel (on the 10°N parallel), with the Andaman islands to the
            north of this latitude, and the Nicobar islands to the south (or by 179 km; 111 miles). The Andaman Sea lies
            to the east and the Bay of Bengal to the west. The island chains are thought to be a submerged extension of
            the Arakan Mountains.
            The territory's capital is the city of Port Blair. The total land area of the islands is approximately 8,249
            km2 (3,185 sq mi). The territory is divided into three districts: the Nicobar District with Car Nicobar as
            its capital, the South Andaman district with Port Blair as its capital, and the North and Middle Andaman
            district with Mayabunder as its capital.
            The islands host the Andaman and Nicobar Command, the only tri-service geographical command of the Indian
            Armed Forces.
            The Andaman Islands are also home to the Sentinelese people, an uncontacted tribe. The Sentinelese are
            considered to be the only people currently known to not have reached further than a Paleolithic level of
            technology; however, this is disputed, as evidence of metalwork was found on their island.The earliest
            archaeological evidence documents some 2,200 years. However, genetic and cultural studies suggest that the
            indigenous Andamanese people may have been isolated from other populations during the Middle Paleolithic,
            which ended 30,000 years ago.Since that time, the Andamanese have diversified into linguistically and
            culturally distinct territorial groups.
            The Nicobar Islands appear to have been populated by people of various backgrounds. By the time of European
            contact, the indigenous inhabitants had coalesced into the Nicobarese people, speaking an Austroasiatic
            language, and the Shompen, whose language is of uncertain affiliation. Neither language is related to
            Andamanese.Rajendra Chola II (1051–1063 CE), used the Andaman and Nicobar Islands as a strategic naval base
            to launch an expedition against the Srivijaya Empire (Indonesia).The Cholas called the island
            Ma-Nakkavaram ("great open/naked land"), found in the Thanjavur inscription of 1050 CE.European
            traveller Marco Polo (12th–13th century) also referred to this island as 'Necuverann' and an ancient form of
            the Tamil name Nakkavaram would have led to the modern name Nicobar during the British colonial
            period.The history of organised European colonisation on the islands began when settlers from the Danish
            East India Company arrived in the Nicobar Islands on 12 December 1755. On 1 January 1756, the Nicobar
            Islands were made a Danish colony, first named New Denmark,and later (December 1756) Frederick's
            Islands (Frederiksøerne). During 1754–1756 they were administered from Tranquebar (in continental
            Danish India).The islands were repeatedly abandoned due to outbreaks of malaria between 14 April
            1759 and 19 August 1768, from 1787 to 1807/05, 1814 to 1831, 1830 to 1834 and gradually from 1848 for
            good.<br>
            From 1 June 1778 to 1784, Austria mistakenly assumed that Denmark had abandoned its claims to the Nicobar
            Islands and attempted to establish a colony on them,renaming them Theresa Islands.
            In 1789, the British set up a naval base and penal colony on Chatham Island next to Great Andaman, where now
            lies the town of Port Blair. Two years later the colony was moved to Port Cornwallis on Great Andaman, but
            it was abandoned in 1796 due to disease.
            In 1858, the British again established a colony at Port Blair, which proved to be more permanent. The
            primary purpose was to set up a penal colony for criminal convicts from the Indian subcontinent.The
            Cellular Jail, which was used to house political prisoners, was constructed on the islands.
            Italy made an attempt at buying the Nicobar Islands from Denmark between 1864 and 1865. The Italian Minister
            of Agriculture and Commerce Luigi Torelli started a negotiation that looked promising, but failed due to the
            unexpected end of his office and the second La Marmora Cabinet. The negotiations were interrupted and never
            brought up again.
            Denmark's presence in the territory ended formally on 16 October 1868 when it sold the rights to the Nicobar
            Islands to Britain, which made them part of British India in 1869.
            In 1872, the Andaman and Nicobar islands were united under a single chief commissioner at Port Blair.</i></p></div>
