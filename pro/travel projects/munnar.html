        MUNNAR</p>
    <P><em><b>Munnar</b> is a town and hill station in the Idukki district of the southwestern Indian state of
        Kerala. Munnar is situated at around 1,600 metres (5,200 ft) above mean sea level,in the Western Ghats
        mountain range. Munnar is also called the "Kashmir of South India" and is a popular honeymoon destination.The
        region has been inhabited by hunter-gatherer tribals like the Malayarayan and Muthuvan for thousands of
        years.Tradition states that Colonel Arthur Wellesley, later the Duke of Wellington, was the first British
        person to pass through Munnar during Tippu Sultan's campaign in Travancore, but this is unsubstantiated. The
        first survey of the terrain was undertaken by Benjamin Swayne Ward in 1816â€“1817, who followed the Periyar into
        the Western Ghats and established a camp at the confluence of three rivers, from which the name of Munnar is
        derived.<br>

        It was to be nearly 50 years later that Sir Charles Trevelyan, Governor of Madras, instructed Col. Douglas
        Hamilton to explore the hill country in the western part of the Madras Presidency, requesting special advice on
        the feasibility of establishing sanatoria for the British in the South and of developing revenue- earning
        projects without endangering the environment, as had happened in Ceylon where coffee had destroyed not only the
        rain forest but also paddy cultivation in the north-central rice bowl of ancient Ceylon. Hamilton climbed
        throughout the Ghats in Munnar region. 15 years later, John Daniel Munro noted that much of Munnar's land was
        suitable for coffee plantations. Munro, Henry Turn and his half-brother AW Turner obtained ownership of the
        Cardamom Hills from the Raja of Travancore and began clearing forest around Devikulam in 1879. Soon many other
        Europeans began establishing tea plantations in the area throughout the 1880s. Early plantations had few
        facilities and were mainly huts of straw.</em></P>
