        characterised by its undulating terrain of low coastal hills.<br>
        The present regions that constitute Thiruvananthapuram were ruled by the Ays who were feudatories of the Chera
        dynasty.In the 12th century, it was conquered by the Kingdom of Venad.In the 18th century, the king
        Marthanda Varma expanded the territory, founded the princely state of Travancore, and made Thiruvananthapuram
        its capital.Travancore became the most dominant state in Kerala by defeating the powerful Zamorin of
        Kozhikode in the battle of Purakkad in 1755.Following India's independence in 1947, Thiruvananthapuram
        became the capital of Travancoreâ€“Cochin state and remained so until the new Indian state of Kerala was formed in
        1956.</em></p>
