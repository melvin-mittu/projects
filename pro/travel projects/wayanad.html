        administrative headquarters at the municipality of Kalpetta. It is the only plateau in Kerala.The Wayanad
        Plateau forms a continuation of the Mysore Plateau, the southern portion of Deccan Plateau which links the
        Western Ghats with the Eastern Ghats. It is set high in the Western Ghats with altitudes ranging from 700 to
        2100 meters.Vellari Mala, a 2,240 m (7,349 ft) high peak situated on the trijunction of Wayanad, Malappuram,
        and Kozhikode districts, is the highest point in Wayanad district. The district was formed on 1 November 1980 as
        the 12th district in Kerala, by carving out areas from Kozhikode and Kannur districts. An area of 885.92 km2 of
        the district is forested.Wayanad has three municipal townsâ€”Kalpetta, Mananthavady and Sulthan Bathery. There
        are many indigenous tribes in this area.The Kabini River, a tributary of Kaveri River, originates at
        Wayanad. Wayanad district, along with the Chaliyar valley in neighbouring Nilambur (Eastern Eranad region) in
        Malappuram district, is known for natural gold fields,which are also seen in other parts of the Nilgiri
        Biosphere Reserve. Chaliyar river, which is the fourth longest river of Kerala, originates on the Wayanad
        plateau. The historically important Edakkal Caves are located in Wayanad district.<br>

        Wayanad district is bordered by Karnataka (Kodagu and Mysore districts) to the north and north-east, Tamil Nadu
        (Nilgiris district) to the south-east, Malappuram to the south, Kozhikode to the south-west and Kannur to the
        north-west.Pulpally in Wayanad boasts the only Lava-Kusha temple in Kerala and Vythiri has the only mirror
        temple in Kerala, which is a Jain temple. Varambetta mosque is the oldest Muslim mosque of Wayanad. People of
        Wayanad live in absolute harmony with each other. Wayanad is famous for its role in the Cotiote War, where

        launched a revolt against the British. Kaniyambetta and Muttil Panchayaths are the centrally located Panchayaths
        with the best access from all corners of Wayanad, while Tavinjal Panchayath is on the northeast border with
