                <i>Kollam,also known by its former name Quilon pronunciation, is an ancient
                    seaport and city on the Malabar Coast of India bordering the Laccadive Sea, which is a part of

                    the southern gateway to the Backwaters of Kerala and is a prominent tourist destination.
                    Kollam is one of the most historic cities with continuous settlements in India.The
                    Malayalam calendar (Kollavarsham) is also known so with the name of the city Kollam.
                    Geographically, Quilon formation seen around coastal cliffs of Ashtamudi Lake, represent
                    sediments laid down in the Kerala basin that existed during Mio-Pliocene times.
                    Kollam has a strong commercial reputation since ancient times. The Arabs, Phoenicians, Chinese,
                    Ethiopians, Syrians, Jews, Chaldeans and Romans have all engaged in trade at the port of Kollam
                    for millennia.As a result of Chinese trade, Kollam was mentioned by Ibn Battuta in the 14th
                    century as one of the five Indian ports he had seen during the course of his twenty-four-year
                    travels.Desinganadu's rajas exchanged embassies with Chinese rulers while there was a
                    flourishing Chinese settlement at Kollam.<br>In the ninth century, on his way to Canton, China,
                    Persian merchant Sulaiman al-Tajir found Kollam to be the only port in India visited by huge
                    Chinese junks. Marco Polo, the Venetian traveller, who was in Chinese service under Kublai Khan
                    in 1275, visited Kollam and other towns on the west coast, in his capacity as a Chinese
                    mandarin.Kollam is also home to one of the seven churches that were established by St
                    Thomas as well as one of the 10 oldest mosques believed to be found by Malik Deenar in Kerala.
                    V. Nagam Aiya in his Travancore State Manual records that in 822 AD two East Syriac bishops Mar
                    Sabor and Mar Proth, settled in Quilon with their followers. Two years later the Malabar Era
                    began (824 AD) and Quilon became the premier city of the Malabar region ahead of Travancore and
                    Cochin.Kollam Port was founded by Mar Sabor at Tangasseri in 825 as an alternative to
                    reopening the inland seaport of Kore-ke-ni Kollam near Backare (Thevalakara), which was also
                    known as Nelcynda and Tyndis to the Romans and Greeks and as Thondi to the Tamils.
                    Kollam city corporation received ISO 9001:2015 certification for municipal administration and
                    services.As per the survey conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) based on

                    with a 31.1% urban growth between 2015 and 2020.It is a coastal city and on the banks of
                    Ashtamudi Lake. The city hosts the administrative offices of Kollam district and is a prominent
                    trading city for the state. The proportion of females to males in Kollam city is second highest

                    India.
                    During the later stages of the rule of the Chera monarchy in Kerala, Kollam emerged as the focal
                    point of trade and politics. Kollam continues to be a major business and commercial centre in
                    Kerala. Four major trading centers around Kollam are Kottarakara, Punalur, Paravur, and
                    Karunagapally. Kollam appeared as Palombe in Mandeville's Travels, where he claimed it contained

            <h2>KOZHIKODE</h2><img src="Kozhikode.jpg" alt="img" style="height: 400px; width: 600px;"></a>
            <P>
                <i>Kozhikode also known as Calicut, is a city in the state of Kerala in southern India on the Malabar
                    coast. Kozhikode is the largest urban area in the state and 195th largest urban area in the world.
                    During classical antiquity and the Middle Ages, Kozhikode was dubbed the “City of Spices” for its
                    role
                    as the major trading point of Eastern spices. It was the capital of an independent kingdom ruled by
                    the
                    Samoothiris(Zamorins) in the Middle Ages and later the capital of the erstwhile Malabar district
                    under
                    British rule. Arab merchants traded with the region as early as 7th century, and Portuguese explorer
                    Vasco da Gama dropped anchor at Kozhikode on 20 May 1498, thus opening a trade route between Europe
                    and
                    Malabar. A Portuguese factory and fort functioned in Kozhikode for a short period (1511–1525, until
                    the
                    Fall of Calicut). The English landed in 1615 (constructing a trading post in 1665), followed by the
                    French (1698) and the Dutch (1752). In 1765, Mysore captured Kozhikode as part of its occupation of
                    the
                    Malabar Coast.
                    While the city has been known in history under different names, Malayalam speaking communities have
                    traditionally called it Kozhikode. Arab merchants called it Qāliqūṭ. Tamils called it Kallikkottai
                    while
                    for the Chinese it was Kalifo. Although the city’s official name is Kozhikode, in English it is
                    sometimes known by its anglicised version, Calicut. The word calico, a fine variety of hand-woven
                    cotton
                    cloth that was exported from the port of Kozhikode, is thought to have been derived from
                    Calicut.<br>
                    Kozhikode is a town with a long recorded history. From time immemorial, the city has attracted
                    travellers with its prosperity. It has traded in spices like black pepper and cardamom with Jews,
                    Arabs,
                    Phoenicians, and Chinese for more than 500 years. As Kozhikode offered full freedom and security,
                    the
                    Arab and the Chinese merchants preferred it to all other ports. Kozhikode was the capital of Malabar
                    during the time of Sri Samoothiri Maharajas, who ruled the region before the British took over. The
                    city’s first recorded contact with Europe was when Vasco da Gama docked at Kappad (18 km north) in
                    May
                    1498, among the leaders of a trade mission from Portugal. He was received by Sri Samoothiri Maharaja
                    himself. Kozhikode and its suburbs formed part of the Polanad kingdom ruled by the Porlatiri. The
                    Eradis
                    of Nediyirippu in Eranad wanted an outlet to the sea, to initiate trade and commerce with the
                    distant
                    lands and after fighting with the king Polatthiri for 48 years conquered the area around
                    Panniyankara.</i>
